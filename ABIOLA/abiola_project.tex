	\chapter{INTRODUCTION TO ADOMIAN DECOMPOSITION METHOD (ADM)}
	\section{General Introduction}
	The Adomian Decomposition Method (ADM) was first established in the 1980's by George Adomian, chairman of Center for Applied Mathematics at the University of Georgia. In the recent years, this method of Adomian Decomposition has be paid attention to in the field of applied mathematics and series solution. In addition, the ADM is widely used to obtain the solution to many types of linear or non-linear ordinary differential equation and integral equations.
	
	The ADM gives the accurate and efficient solution to problem in a direct and simply way without the use of linearization and partubation which can change the physical behaviour of the method.
	
	For the purpose of this study, we consider the solution of second order differential equation of the form 
	\begin{eqnarray*}
		P(x)\frac{d^2y}{dx^2}+ Q(x)\frac{dy}{dx} + R(x)y = F(x)
	\end{eqnarray*}
	or
	\begin{eqnarray*}
		y\dprime P(x) + y\sprime Q(x) + R(x)y=F(x)
	\end{eqnarray*}
	with initial conditions
	\begin{eqnarray*}
		y(x_0) = y_0 \text{ and } y\sprime(x_0) = y_1
	\end{eqnarray*}
	Where $P(x), Q(x), R(x)$ and $F(x)$ are continuous functions of $x$; and $y_0$ and $y_1$ are given constant.
	
	\section{Definition of Relative Terms}
	\subsection{Differential Equation}
	Differential equation is an equation that contains at least one derivative of an unknown function, either ordinary derivative $\dsp\left(\frac{d}{dy}\right)$, or a partial derivative $\dsp\left(\frac{\partial}{\partial x}\right)$.
	
	\subsection{General Second Order Ordinary Differential Equation}
	The general Second Order Ordinary Differential Equation of an independent variable $x$ and dependent variable $y$ is given by 
	\begin{eqnarray*}
		\begin{split}
			P(x)\frac{d^2y}{dx^2} + Q(x)\frac{dy}{dx} + R(x)y &= f(x) \hspace{1cm} \text{Or }\sps
			y\dprime P(x) + y\sprime Q(x) + R(x)y &= f(x)
		\end{split}
	\end{eqnarray*}
	where $P(x), Q(x), R(x),f(x)$ are continuous functions of $x$.
	
	\subsection{Initial Value Problem}
	An initial-value problem for the second order equation
	\begin{eqnarray*}
		y\dprime P(x) + y\sprime Q(x) + R(x)y = f(x)
	\end{eqnarray*}
	consists of finding a solution $y$ of the differential equation that also satisfies initial condition of the form
	\begin{eqnarray*}
		y(x_0) = y_0 \hspace{2cm} y\sprime(x_0) = y_1
	\end{eqnarray*}
	where $y_0$ and $y_1$ are given constants and $P(x), Q(x), R(x),f(x)$ are continuous functions of $x$ and $P(x)\neq 0$.
	
	\subsection{Operator}
	An operator is a function that takes a function as an argument instead of number. Examples of operators are:
	\begin{eqnarray*}
		L = \frac{d}{dx}\; ; \; L=\frac{\partial}{\partial x}\; ; \ \; L = \int dx\; ; \; L= \int_a^b dx
	\end{eqnarray*}
	
	\subsection{Adomian Polynomials $\mathbf{(A_n)}$}
	The Adomian Polynomials of a non-linear differential equation is obtained using the formula
	\begin{equation}
		A_n = \frac{1}{n!}~\frac{d^n}{d\lambda^2}\left[ N\left(\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}\lambda^n U_n\right)\right]_{\lambda=0}\hspace{1cm} n=0,1,2,\ldots
	\end{equation}

	\section{Aims and Objectives}
	\subsection{Aim}
	The aim of this project work is to adopt the method of Adomian decomposition to solve Linear and Non-linear Second Order Differential Equation of the form 
	\begin{equation*}
		y\dprime P(x) + y\sprime Q(x) + R(x)y = f(x)
	\end{equation*}
	where $P(x), Q(x), R(x),f(x)$ are continuous functions of $x$.

	\begin{enumerate}
		\item Describe Adomian decomposition method

	%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%CHAPTER TWO%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
	\chapter{Literature Review}
	\section{Introduction}
	The study of differential equation began in 1675 when Leibniz wrote the equation
	\begin{eqnarray}
		\int x dx = \frac{1}{2}x^2
	\end{eqnarray}
	Leibniz inaugurated the differential sign $\dsp\left(\frac{dy}{dx}\right)$ and integral sign $\dsp\Big(\int\Big)$ in (1675) a hundred years before the period of initial discovery of general method of integrating ordinary differential equation ended. (Ince 1956).\\
	
	\NI According to Sasser (2005) in Orapine, Tiza and Amon(2016) the search for general methods of integrating began when Newton classified the first order differential equation into three classes:
	\begin{gather}
		\frac{dy}{dx} = f(x)\sps
		\frac{dy}{dx} = f(x,y)\sps
		x\frac{\partial u}{\partial y}+ y\frac{\partial u}{\partial y} = u
	\end{gather}
	
	\NI The first two classes contain only ordinary derivative of one or more dependent variable, with respect to a single independent variable, and are known today as ordinary differential equation. The third class involves partial derivatives of one dependent variable and today its called partial differential equation.\\
	
	\NI In the 20$^{th}$ century, Ordinary differential equation(ODE) is widely applied in many field and the numerical solution has made a great development.\\
	
	\NI Many of the problems in the field of engineering is expressed in terms of boundary value problem (BVP) which are boundary differential equation with boundary conditions and also in terms of initial value problem (IVP) which are ODE with initial condition of the unknown function at a given domain
